## Installation

### By Package Control

1. Download & Install **`Sublime Text 3`** (https://www.sublimetext.com/3)
1. Go to the menu **`Tools -> Install Package Control`**, then,
   wait few seconds until the installation finishes up
1. Now,
   Go to the menu **`Preferences -> Package Control`**
1. Type **`Add Channel`** on the opened quick panel and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>
1. Then,
   input the following address and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>
   ```
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evandrocoan/StudioChannel/master/channel.json
   ```
1. Go to the menu **`Tools -> Command Palette...
   (Ctrl+Shift+P)`**
1. Type **`Preferences:
   Package Control Settings â€“ User`** on the opened quick panel and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>
1. Then,
   find the following setting on your **`Package Control.sublime-settings`** file:
   ```js
       "channels":
       [
           "https://packagecontrol.io/channel_v3.json",
           "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evandrocoan/StudioChannel/master/channel.json",
       ],
   ```
1. And,
   change it to the following, i.e.,
   put the **`https://raw.githubusercontent...`** line as first:
   ```js

## Changing color scheme
If you don't like colors used in the find results buffer just copy [this file](https://github.com/aziz/BetterFindBuffer/blob/master/FindResults.hidden-tmTheme) to your User folder, change colors and save it and then create a file called `Find Results.sublime-settings` in your User folder and paste the code below:

``` json
{
  "color_scheme": "Path to your custom color scheme file. e.g. Packages/User/Custom_FindResults.hidden-tmTheme",
}
```

Alternatively, you can use [BetterFindBuffer-Designer](http://bobtherobot.github.io/BetterFindBuffer-Designer/) tool as GUI to easily customize the Find-Results color scheme.
